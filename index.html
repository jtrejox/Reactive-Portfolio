            <p>I'm a coding student currently trying to break into the Tech field, I've had a passion for computer hardware from an early age, 
               a passion I inherited from my father who was an electronics engineer and worked on some of the first mainframe computers for 
               Digital Equipment Corp. This passion naturaly progressed into an interest in coding since it is such an integral part of how 
               hardware functions.<br>
               I've worked as a computer and printer hardware technician as well as various other jobs in the printing and mailing industry 
               I am very excited to start a new page in my career and expand my knowledge of all types of languages and systems as well as broaden
               my intelectual horizons with new projects and challenges.<br>
               This is a comprehensive gallery of all the projects I've built or have collaborated on, please feel free to peruse them. <br>
               I would also welcome any feedback you might have, since I am always striving to improve my skills and knowledge.
